var age =23;
console.log(age)

//at run time,the value got changed
age="Eshaan"
console.log(age)


//Naming convention
//spaces are not allowed or put ( - )  in between
//if a variable is declared as in integer, it cannot start with a number
//ex  var 1age=22   IS NOT CORRECT
//most preferable way is camel casing (camelCasing)

//Var->  global scope
//Let and const-> local scope


//1 MAJOR difference what segregates const from the rest 2 is that
//we have to set the value always, it shows error, instead of undefined 
//once a data type is assigend as well as the value, it cannot be chaanged


//var- Global Scope
//Re-aggined
//kahi bhe acces karlo

//let- local
//re-assigned
//access sirf khud ke block kei andar

//cont-local
//CANNOT BE re-assgined
//access sirf khud ke block kei andar

//CONST is mostly used in production
